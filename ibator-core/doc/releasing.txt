Releasing Ibator
================

Core Release Process
====================

This process is similar to what is show at http://maven.apache.org/developers/release/apache-release.html
except that Ibator is not using the nexus repository manager, so the deployment
steps are different (and we are not publishing snapshot versions).

1. mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true

   Make sure the new POMs look OK (pom.xml.next and pom.xml.tag)
   
2. mvn release:clean

3. mvn release:prepare -Dusername=xxx -Dpassword=xxx

4. mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=local::default::file:/temp/IbatorDeploy

5. scp the new artifacts to /www/people.apache.org/repo/m2-ibiblio-rsync-repository/org/apache/ibatis/ibator/etc.


Eclipse Release Process
=======================

1. Build the new version of the Eclipse feature:
  - Increment the version number of the feature
  - Increment the version number of any plugin that has changed
  - Run the build.xml script in the build project (creates a new feature version
    at \temp\ibator.build\etc.)
  - Add the new feature and plugin jars to the IbatorUpdateSite project
  - Add the new version of the feature to site.xml in the IbatorUpdateSite
    project (manually)

3. Zip the contents of the update site (remove project metadata)
  
4. Commit everything

9. Copy the new versions of ibator-core and ibator-maven-plugin from the local maven repo
