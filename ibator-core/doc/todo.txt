Core:

  Future

    1. Write page explaining how to use the GENERIC DAOs
    2. Change the base API to allow specifying a connection at
       runtime, rather than requiring a connection in the 
       XML config.
    3. Relationships?
    4. Java merger with ANTLR?
    5. Add a way to override default types in the JavaTypeResolver
    6. <tableSet> - to allow specification of common attributes for a set of
       tables


Eclipse:

  Future
  
    1. Write a launch configuration for the plugin to allow better
       control of the class path.
       
    2. Get rid of the "Generate iBATIS Artifacts" popup menu - should
       only run with a launch configuration or with Ant.
